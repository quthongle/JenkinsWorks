Cloning into '<...>'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/<...>.git/': error setting certificate verify locations:
  CAfile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

#fixing
git config --system http.sslcainfo "<path to local git>/curl-ca-bundle.crt"
or — not really recommended — you may choose to switch off SSL checks completely by executing:

git config --system http.sslverify false
For both cases, this will result in changes to [git-install-dir]/etc/gitconfig file, which may be edited directly, too.
#-----------------------
When using https you will need to supply password or using a certificate. In your case looks like the certificate is not a valid one.

Try fixing it like this by telling git where to find the certificate:

// Add the certificate to your configuration file
git config --system http.sslcainfo "C:\Program Files (x86)\git\bin\curl-ca-bundle.crt"
Alternatively, you could disable SSL checks:

// or switch off SSL checks completely by executing:
git config --system http.sslverify false
Set this in your config to disable it only for the given url and not for all requests

[http "https://weak.example.com"]
    sslVerify = false
http.sslVerify

Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
http.sslCAInfo

File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS

or just reintall git :)
